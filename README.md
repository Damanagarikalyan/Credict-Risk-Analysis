Credit risk analysis is a process that determines a borrower's ability to meet debt obligations and the lender's aim when advancing credit. 
The goal is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is unlikely to repay the loan or labeled as a bad risk through automated machine learning algorithms.
Expected losses, risk-adjusted return, and other considerations all serve to inform the outcome of the credit risk analysis process.
